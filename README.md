## Introduction:
This repository contains code and resources for a sentiment analysis project. The goal of this project is to analyze and classify text data into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) using machine learning techniques. 

## Project Structure:

data: Contains the dataset used for sentiment analysis.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for different phases of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models: Trained models and model-related files.
utils: Utility functions and scripts used throughout the project.
README.md: Overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Project Phases:

1. Data Exploration:

Explore the Sentiment Analysis dataset to understand its structure, features, and size.
Identify key variables such as text content and sentiment labels.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Perform text preprocessing tasks, including lowercasing, removing stop words, and handling special characters.
Tokenize and lemmatize words to prepare the text for sentiment analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of sentiment labels.
Visualize the distribution using histograms or pie charts to understand the balance of sentiment classes.


4. Text Vectorization:
Convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
Choose an appropriate vectorization method based on the characteristics of the dataset.

6. Model Selection:
Explore and implement different machine learning models suitable for text classification, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize its performance.
Utilize techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.

7. Cross-Validation:
Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalization performance of the model and prevent overfitting.

8. Model Interpretability:
Interpret the model's predictions by analyzing feature importance or using techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).
Understand which words or features contribute most to sentiment predictions.

9. Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluate the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics for sentiment analysis, such as confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and ROC-AUC.
